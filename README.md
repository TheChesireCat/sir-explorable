# Dynamics Explorables

Small explorables I made to understand Modeling Dynamical Processes on Complex Networks (PHYS-7335, Spring 2026).

## Demos
- `index.html` — landing page with links to the demos.
- `sir.html` — SIR mixing explorable (deterministic vs stochastic, uncertainty bands, run-by-run overlays, mobile controls).
- `sir-transtiion.html` — phase transition scan across \((\beta, \mu)\) with live scatter, brushing, and run-level detail.

## Quick start
Open `index.html` in a browser. No build step.

## Notes
- All demos are single-file HTML (inline CSS/JS).
- MathJax is loaded for inline math rendering.
- The phase transition demo can be heavy for large grids; start with fewer divisions.

## Credits
Built with help from the Codex CLI.
